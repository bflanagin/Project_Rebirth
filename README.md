## November 1st-30th: Development Sprint

This November will be the first development sprint for Project Rebirth. It may also be included as a submission for GoGodotJam as the game itself is new even if this will be my third time using a lot of the assets. 

The goal will be to complete Phase1 in [Projects](https://github.com/bflanagin/Project_Rebirth/projects/1) and I will be blogging my progress and streaming my work on [Peakd](https://peakd.com/@bflanagin/) and [Vimm](https://www.vimm.tv/c/bflanagin) respectively. 

More news in the coming days.
